# ML_Project28-WineQualityPrediction

### Wine Quality Prediction with Machine Learning
This project investigates the quality of red wine using machine learning algorithms based on various chemical properties. The goal is to predict the quality of a wine sample given its chemical composition.

### Getting Started

##### This project requires the following libraries:
```
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn
```
##### You can install them using pip:
```
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Data
The project expects a dataset in CSV format containing red wine samples and their corresponding chemical properties. You can use the "winequality-red.csv" dataset available online or a similar dataset.

### Usage
1.Load the data: The code includes a script to load the CSV data using pandas.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize the distribution of features across different quality levels using bar charts.

Gain insights into potential relationships between features and wine quality.

3.Preprocess the data:
Convert the quality variable into a binary classification problem (good vs bad).

Encode categorical data (e.g., quality labels) into numerical values.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Standardize the features using standard scaling for improved model performance.

4.Train and Evaluate Machine Learning Models:
The code implements three machine learning algorithms:

Random Forest Classifier

Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier

Support Vector Machine Classifier

Each model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the testing data.

Classification reports and confusion matrices are used to assess model performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV is applied to the SVM model to potentially improve its performance.

### Interpretation:
Analyze the results of each model and identify the one with the best performance.

Consider the trade-offs between different models based on your specific requirements.

### Notes
This project provides a basic framework for wine quality prediction using machine learning.

Experiment with different hyperparameters, feature engineering techniques, and machine learning algorithms to potentially improve the accuracy and generalizability of the models.

Consider incorporating additional data sources or features that might be relevant to wine quality.

This project serves as a starting point for your exploration of wine quality prediction with machine learning. Feel free to modify and extend the code to fit your specific needs and data.
